Hello my name is Shittu Olumide Ayodeji, I am a software developer. I feel so honored and happy to have worked with the aeternity blockchain after taking the aeternity 101 course on [dacade](wwww.dacade.org) .

## Problem statement

I was able to come with an aepp that runs on aeternity blockchain, the aepp is similar to [fiver](www.fiver.com), [upwork](www.upwork.com) and other freelance websites but the difference is that once a job owner regsiters a job and freelancers message him/her via the URL in the description and they get the job, they can come bcak to the aep and vote the jib owner using some aethos. 



THEERBY RANKING THE JOB OWNER HIGH, GAINING POPULARITY AND EARNING AETERNITY TOKENS. THE MEAIN IDEA BEHIND THE WHOLE AEPP IS TO AID TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS JOB OWNERS HAVR BEEN GOING BACK ON WORDS AND AGREEMENTS MADE WITH THE DEVELOPER, SO WITH THIS AEPP DEVELOPERS OR FREELANCERS CAN KNOW WO TO WORK FOR AND WHO NOT TO WORK FOR. THANKS

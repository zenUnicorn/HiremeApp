Hello my name is Shittu Olumide Ayodeji, I am a software developer. I feel so honored and happy to have worked with the aeternity blockchain after taking the aeternity 101 course on [dacade](wwww.dacade.org) .

I WAS ABLE TO COME UP WITH AN AEPP THAT RUNS ON AETERNITY BLOCKCHAIN THE AEPP IS SIMILAR TO FIVER, UPWORKA AND FREELANCE WEBSITES BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONCE A JOB OWNERS REGISTERS A JOB AND FREELANCERS MESSAGE HIM UP VIA THE URL IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION AND THEY GET THE JOB, THEY CAN COME BACK TO THE AEPP AND VOTE THE JOB OWNER USING SOME AETHOS. THEERBY RANKING THE JOB OWNER HIGH, GAINING POPULARITY AND EARNING AETERNITY TOKENS. THE MEAIN IDEA BEHIND THE WHOLE AEPP IS TO AID TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS JOB OWNERS HAVR BEEN GOING BACK ON WORDS AND AGREEMENTS MADE WITH THE DEVELOPER, SO WITH THIS AEPP DEVELOPERS OR FREELANCERS CAN KNOW WO TO WORK FOR AND WHO NOT TO WORK FOR. THANKS

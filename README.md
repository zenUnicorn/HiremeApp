I feel so honored and happy to have worked with the aeternity blockchain after taking the aeternity 101 course on [dacade](wwww.dacade.org).

## Problem statement

I was able to come with an aepp that runs on aeternity blockchain, the aepp is similar to [fiver](www.fiver.com), [upwork](www.upwork.com) and other freelance websites but the difference is that once a job owner regsiters a job and freelancers message him/her via the URL in the description and they get the job, they can come bcak to the aep and vote the job owner using some aethos. Thereby ranking the job owner high, gainig popularity and earning aeternity tokens. 


The main idea behind the whole aepp is to aid transparency, because over the years job posters/owners have been going back on their word and agreements made with the developer/creative. 

With the aepp, developers or freelancers can know who ro work for and who they should not work for.
